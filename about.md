## About Me

Hi! My name is Shubham Kejriwal. I’m a third-year Ph.D. student in the gravitational waves group led by Prof. Alvin Chua in the department of Physics at the National University of Singapore. I primarily work on developing the data analysis pipeline for the upcoming LISA mission. I am proficient in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, with a working knowledge of general-relativistic waveform modeling.

## What I Do

### Research Work  

  I primarily work on developing different aspects of the data analysis pipeline for the upcoming space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA. Some broad directions in this context are highlighted below. You can read more about my research [here](/shubham/research/) and access my full list of publications [here](/shubham/publications/).
  
  - GW waveform modeling and inference of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs).  
  - Inferring environments and beyond-GR ("beyond-vacuum-GR") effects using the LISA mission.  
  - Search for electromagnetic counterparts of EMRIs.  

### Teaching  
  I have contributed as a Teaching Assistant for multiple courses (both graduate and undergraduate) during my Ph.D. In my role, I have instructed tutorials, invigilated, assessed assignment submissions, and provided general guidance to class sizes of roughly 40-100 students. Here's a full list of courses I have assisted for:  
  - [PC5252](https://nusmods.com/courses/PC5252/bayesian-statistics-and-machine-learning) "Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning" (2 semesters).  
  - [COS1000](https://nusmods.com/courses/COS1000/computational-thinking-for-scientists) "Computational Thinking for Scientists" (3 semesters).   
  - [HS1502](https://nusmods.com/courses/HS1502/conceptual-introduction-to-machine-learning) "Conceptual Introduction to Machine Learning" (2 semesters).  

    
### Presentations
  Below is a short list of talks and posters I have presented for various research conferences and science outreach programs. Find a full list in my [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/Shubham_Kejriwal_CV.pdf).    
  - ([Talk](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/event/5189/submission/77)) 15th International LISA Symposium 2024, July 2024, University College, Dublin, Ireland.  
  - ([Talk](https://www.caprameeting.org/capra-meetings/capra-27)) 27th Capra Meeting on Radiation Reaction in General Relativity, June 2024, National University of Singapore.
  - ([Talk](https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/calendar/ligo-seminar-86)) LIGO Seminar, April 2024, Caltech, USA.  
  - (Poster) Physics Engagement Camp, March 2024, National University of Singapore.  
  

### Other Contributions  
  I am a member of multiple international research collaborations including:  
  - [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org/) (core member)
  - [FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW)](https://github.com/BlackHolePerturbationToolkit/FastEMRIWaveforms) Collaboration  
  
  I also enjoy contributing to science events, by organizing them:  
  - Local Organizing Committee member, [Capra27](https://www.caprameeting.org/capra-meetings/capra-27).   
  - Executive Committee member, Physics Graduate Students' Society, National University of Singapore.  
  
  or by participating:  
  - [Beyond the Horizon Program](https://icts.res.in/program/beyondhorizon), March 2025, ICTS-TIFR, India.  
  - [EMRI Search and Inference within the LISA Global Fit - Part 1](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/34916/overview), June 2025, APC, Paris, France.

  When I am not working, I sometimes [vlog](https://www.youtube.com/@ShubhamKejriwal). I also love travelling and trying out different cuisines (which is however a restrictive hobby being vegetarian). I am a big Formula One fan. I enjoy trekking and swimming, so I am both a mountain *and* a beach person!
