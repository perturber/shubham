# Research Overview  

Below, I provide a slightly more ellaborate (and mostly self-contained) overview of my research. Still, the best way to learn about my research is to read my articles. You can find them on the [Publications](/shubham/publications) page.

## Background

### LISA and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals

I primarily work on developing the data analysis pipeline in various contexts (as you will see below) for the upcoming space-based gravitational wave observatory, i.e. the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, or LISA for short [(1)](https://lisa.nasa.gov/). LISA was recently adopted by the European Space Agency (ESA), which means it is now under construction, and is on track to be launched sometime in the middle of the next decade [(2)](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/LISA/Capturing_the_ripples_of_spacetime_LISA_gets_go-ahead).
