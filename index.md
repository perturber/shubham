## About Me

Hi! My name is Shubham Kejriwal. I’m a third-year Ph.D. student in Physics at the National University of Singapore. I am working on gravitational wave data analysis for the upcoming LISA mission. I am proficient in Bayesian statistics and machine learning, with a working knowledge of general-relativistic waveform modeling.

## What I Do

### Research Work  

  I primarily work on developing different aspects of the data analysis pipeline for the upcoming space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA. Some broad directions in this context are highlighted below. You can also read more about my research [here](/shubham/research/) and access my full list of publications [here](/shubham/publications/).  
  
  - GW waveform modeling and inference of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs).  
  - Inferring environments and beyond-GR ("beyond-vacuum-GR") effects using the LISA mission.  
  - Search for electromagnetic counterparts of EMRIs.  

### Teaching  
  I have contributed as a Teaching Assistant for multiple courses (both graduate and undergraduate) during my Ph.D. In my role, I have instructed tutorials, invigilated, assessed assignment submissions, and provided general guidance to class sizes of roughly 40-100 students. Here's a full list of courses I have assisted for:  
  - PC5252 "Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning" (2 semesters).  
  - COS1000 "Computational Thinking for Scientists" (3 semesters).   
  - HS1502 "Conceptual Introduction to Machine Learning" (2 semesters).  

    
### Talks, Posters, and Outreach
  Beyond research and teaching, I am keen on sharing the impact of my research and in science outreach generally. Below is a short list of talks and posters I have presented for various research conferences and science outreach programs. In addition, I have also attended several workshops and schools during my Ph.D. to dive deeper into niche topics within gravitational wave research. You can find a full list of participations in my [Curriculum Vitae](/assets/Shubham_Kejriwal_CV.pdf).
  - [15th International LISA Symposium 2024](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/event/5189/submission/77) Talk, July 2024, University College, Dublin, Ireland.  
  - [LIGO Seminar Talk](https://www.caltech.edu/campus-life-events/calendar/ligo-seminar-86), April 2024, Caltech, USA.  
  - Physics Engagement Camp Poster, March 2024, National University of Singapore.
