## About Me

Hi! My name is Shubham Kejriwal. I’m a third-year Ph.D. student in Physics at the National University of Singapore. I am working on gravitational wave data analysis for the upcoming LISA mission. I specialize in waveform modeling, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning, with a working knowledge of general-relativistic waveform modeling.

## What I Do

I primarily work on developing the data analysis pipeline for the upcoming space-based gravitational wave observatory LISA. Some broad directions are highlighted below. You can read more about my research [here](/shubham/research/).

- Waveform modeling and code implementation.  
- Inferring environments and beyond-GR ("beyond-vacuum-GR") effects using the LISA mission.  
- Search for electromagnetic counterparts of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.
